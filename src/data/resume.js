    "I’m currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems and Operations Management in the United States, where I focus on business intelligence, data engineering, and decision analytics. My goal is not just to analyze data, but to design systems that make data trustworthy, scalable, and actionable.",
    "Over the past 2+ years, I’ve worked across analytics, reporting, and operational environments - analyzing 100,000+ records, building SQL-driven pipelines, and developing dashboards that align technical outputs with executive-level decision making.",
    "During my recent internship at MTF Biologics, I supported the Donor Services division in optimizing reporting and process visibility within the tissue lifecycle. Being part of a system that contributes to improving patient outcomes and extending the functional life of donated tissue reinforced why I care deeply about accuracy, compliance, and data integrity.",
    "Previously, at Oracle and other enterprise environments, I gained experience working with structured datasets at scale - where performance, data governance, and stakeholder communication matter as much as the analysis itself.",
    "I approach every problem with structured thinking: define the metric clearly, validate the data source, automate where possible, and communicate insights in a way that reduces ambiguity. My ambition is to grow into a Business Intelligence and Data Engineering role where analytics drives measurable operational improvement."
